## Introduction

Pascal's Triangle is a useful mathematical concept that has applications in algebra, combinatorics, and probability. The goal of this project is to write a function that returns a list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle of a given size.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.4
- Basic understanding of lists and loops in Python

## Function Signature

The function should have the following signature:

```python
def pascal_triangle(n):
    """
    Returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n.
    """
